# Inspiration-Pomodoro
A simple Pomodoro Timer iOS App that shows daily quotes to boost your productivity!
# Installation 
This project uses <a href="https://cocoapods.org/"> CocoPods</a> to organize external libraries. No installations are needed.
# User Experience
* The App consists of two tabs, Timer and Favorites.
* The first tab the user sees is the timer view. The user can pick from three different durations "Work Session, Long Break, Short Break". The user can start and stop the timer. 
* When the user presses the wiggling quote button the app fetches The Quote of the day and presents it modally.
* The user can save and share the quote!
* The settings button directs the user to the settings view where the timings of each session "Work, Long Break, Short Break" can be edited. The changes are saved for future use.
* The second tab is the favorites tab. The user can browse the quotes that were saved previously. The quotes can be viewed on a different view or deleted from the table.
